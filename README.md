# Securing Federated Learning

This project demonstrates the integration of Verifiable Credentials into a Federated Learning environment for Authentication & Gradient Sharing, inspired by concepts from the [PyDentity](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity) project.

## TL,DR;
Boot up the necessary infrastructure by
1. Installing all dependencies: `pipenv install`
2. Running `docker compose up -d`

That's it! Feel free to explore my Jupyter notebooks stored at `/notebooks`. Make sure to use the corresponding kernel installed at step one. As already indicated, I used [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for package management.
